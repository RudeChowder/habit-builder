# Habit Builder

## Overview
Hello! The goal of this application is to allow users to build habits they want to stick with. By utilizing checkins, users can track their progress across multiple habits and set checkin goals they wish to achieve.

## How to Use
To use this application, fork or clone the repo onto your machine. Run `bundle install` and spin up your server with `rails s`. Visit your `localhost` to reach the home page and get started building lasting habits!

## Features
### Home Page
Once opened, the application should land on the home page. Here you can use the navbar to sign up or sign in and begin tracking your progress.

### User Profile
This is the dashboard for your progress. This page will show you:
* The habits you have checked in for
* Any in-progress goals you have set and your progress toward achieving them
* You last three checkins

### Habits
Habits are the things you want to build into your daily life. You can choose them from the existing list or create new ones while checking in/setting new goals. Currently habits are shared across all users, but there are plans to compartmentalize them to individual users for privacy reasons.

### Goals
You can set a goal for the total number of checkins you'd like to reach for any habit you want to build. Once you have done enough checkins to reach that goal, it will be marked as achieved. You can set a long term goal or many smaller ones to check off as you go. It's up to you!

### Checkins
Each day (or whenever is convenient) you can checkin on the app to track any habits you completed. The date can be specified per checkin, in case you need to enter historical data, or you just missed a day and want to fill it in.

## Please enjoy the app, and build some new habits!
